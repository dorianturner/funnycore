# Computer Architecture CW FunnyCore Compiler

The spec expects us to get our assembly program right without giving us any
way to test our code.

Screw that.

# Usage instructions

First compile the program with `g++ main.cpp`

Create your test program and save it in a file e.g. prog.txt (There is an example there already)

Run with `./a.out <file> <optional register initial values>`

To run the test file would be `./a.out prog.txt`

In your optional register values they are just separated by commas e.g. `10,2` with no spaces

Enjoy.
