# Computer Architecture CW FunnyCore Compiler

The spec expects us to get our assembly program right without giving us any
way to test our code.

Screw that.

# Usage instructions

First compile the program with `g++ main.cpp`
Create your test program and put it into `prog.txt` (There is an example there already)
Run with `./a.out`
Enjoy.
